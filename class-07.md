# HTML Tables
Table structure consist of (table) opening and closing tags inside it there are (tr) table raws opening and closing tags including the (td) table data opening and closing tags, also there are (th) table headings opening and closing tags , they are similar to table data but represents the heading of each column in the table.
**colspan and rowspan**
Colspan attribute used to make a table data span over the columns whereas Rowspan attribute used to make a table data span over rows by giving these attributes values.
**Long tables**
In long tables we can split the table using three elements:

# Javascript objects
## two main ways to create the objects; literal notation or the constructor notation
#### Creating object (constructor notation)
**new** keyword with **object()** constructor create a blank object which then you can add to it properties and methods.
#### Updating an object
You can update the value of properties either by using the *dot notation* or the *square brackets[]*
#### Creating many objects
Object constructor use the function as a template for creating objects. The name of the constructor function start with a capital letter unlike the other functions that start with small letter. So then you create the instances of the object using the function constructor , the new keyword followed by calling the function you wrote.
#### Adding and deleting properties
You can add peoperties after an object by typing the (object's name.property=" ", 10 or boolean) and to delete a property use the keyword delete (delete objenct's name.property).

- The keyword *this* is commonly used inside functions and objects. 
#### Arrays
They are actually a type of objects that hold a set of key/pair values like the objects. Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other). 
#### Built-in objects
That represent things like the browser window and the current web page shown in that window. These built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages. 
An *object model* is a group of objects, each of which represent related things from the real world.Together they form a model of something larger. 
JavaScript also has several *built-in objects* such as (String, Number, Math, and Date). Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
